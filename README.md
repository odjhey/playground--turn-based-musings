## Notes

- issue commands, but delayed response (stacking? or accumulated actions?)

- tank - can retreat in 3turns (actions that has more than 1 turn counts to execute)
- tank in front decreases damage taken by those behind (spatial aware damage computations)

- try with a standard attack pattern of an enemy

- assign units to correct enemies (classic rock paper scissors)

- 1 move corresponds to 3 ticks? (see above re turn counts, or this may mean micro attacks could be triggered for each tick, like "phases" in table top games)

- consumable resource management
- 10-15mins game session
- replayable (preview sense) save files
